# Round-Robin-CPU-scheduling
Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.

- It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU.
-	One of the most commonly used technique in CPU scheduling as a core.
-	It is preemptive as processes are assigned CPU only for a fixed slice of time at most.
-	The disadvantage of it is more overhead of context switching.

We implement the algorithm in Java.
